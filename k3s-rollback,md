# **Rolling Back K3s**

You can roll back the K3s Kubernetes version after an upgrade, using a combination of K3s binary downgrade and datastore restoration. Rollback can be performed on clusters of all types, including a single-node SQLite, an external datastore, or an embedded etcd. When rolling back to a previous Kubernetes minor version, you must have a datastore snapshot taken on the Kubernetes minor version you wish to roll back to.

**warning**

If you cannot restore the database, you cannot roll back to a previous minor version.

# **Important Considerations**

- **Backups:** Before upgrading, ensure you have a valid database or etcd snapshot from your cluster running the older version of K3s. Without a backup, a rollback is impossible.
- **Potential Data Loss:** The `k3s-killall.sh` script forcefully terminates K3s processes and may result in data loss if applications are not properly shut down.
- **Version Specifics:** Always verify K3s and component versions before and after the rollback.

# **Rolling Back a K3s Cluster**

**SQLiteEmbedded etcdExternal Database**

- SQLite
- Embedded etcd
- External Database

To roll back a K3s cluster when using an external database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL), follow these steps:

1. If the cluster is running and the Kubernetes API is available, gracefully stop workloads by draining all nodes:
    
    ```bash
    kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data <NODE-ONE-NAME> <NODE-TWO-NAME> <NODE-THREE-NAME> ...
    
    ```
    
    **note**
    
    This process may disrupt running applications.
    
2. On each node, stop the K3s service and all running pod processes:
    
    ```bash
    k3s-killall.sh
    
    ```
    
3. Restore a database snapshot taken before upgrading K3s and verify the integrity of the database. For example, if you're using PostgreSQL, run the following command:
    
    ```bash
    pg_restore -U <DB-USER> -d <DB-NAME> <BACKUP-FILE>
    
    ```
    
4. On each node, roll back the K3s binary to the previous version.
    - Clusters with Internet Access:
        - Server nodes:
            
            ```bash
            curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=vX.Y.Zk3s1 INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="server" sh -
            
            ```
            
        - Agent nodes:
            
            ```bash
            curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=vX.Y.Zk3s1 INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="agent" sh -
            
            ```
            
    - Air-gapped Clusters:
        - Download the artifacts and run the [install script](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/airgap#2-install-k3s) locally. Verify the K3s version after install with `k3s --version` and reapply any custom configurations that were used before the upgrade.
5. Start the K3s service on each node:
    
    ```bash
    systemctl start k3s
    
    ```
    
6. Verify the K3s service status with `systemctl status k3s`.

# **Verification**

After the rollback, verify the following:

- K3s version: `k3s --version`
- Kubernetes cluster health: `kubectl get nodes`
- Application functionality.
- Check the K3s logs for errors.
